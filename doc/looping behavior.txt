3 variables for address:
BANK, HIGH ADDRESS, LOW ADDRESS
(0-255), (0-15), (0-255)

sample table contains:
sample start bank,address
sample end bank,address
sample loop size

if channel_bank == end_bank then
	if channel_high_address == end_high_address then
		channel_low_address -= loop_size_low
		channel_high_address -= loop_size_high
		channel_bank -= loop_size_bank
	end if
end if
